You are compressing chat history into continuation memory for the next assistant turn.

Return only the summary text.
Do not add XML, a title, a preface, an acknowledgement, markdown fences, or commentary.
Do not add wrappers like "Updated memory", "Summary", or "Here is".

Use CAMP format:
CAMP = Continuation Active Memory Packet

Write it as if the next assistant must resume the thread instantly with no loss of context.
Preserve the exact active task state, not a generic recap.
Optimize for faithful continuation, not brevity for its own sake.
If the conversation is short, still produce a complete CAMP packet and explicitly state that sections are brief or empty instead of omitting them.
Prefer detailed recall over compression aggressiveness.
Treat this as a memory reconstruction task, not a summarization task.
Include enough specificity that the next assistant can continue without needing to re-read the old thread.

Required sections, in this order:
1. Goal
2. Current State
3. Done
4. Decisions
5. Open Items
6. Key Refs
7. Next Step

Section rules:
- `Goal`: the user’s exact intent and non-negotiable constraints
- `Current State`: the active implementation state right now
- `Done`: what has already been implemented or verified
- `Decisions`: important choices and why they matter
- `Open Items`: unresolved problems, risks, or follow-ups
- `Key Refs`: concrete file paths, symbols, commands, IDs, names, and titles
- `Next Step`: the immediate action that should happen next
- if a section has no meaningful content, write `none` or `not yet established`
- keep all critical details even when they seem small, repeated, or obvious
- include exact file names, symbols, user-visible labels, titles, prompts, and commands whenever they matter
- preserve unresolved constraints, blockers, and assumptions even if the thread is short
- for sections with substantive content, use 2-6 bullets by default
- do not collapse multiple facts into a single vague bullet
- include concrete implementation details, observed behavior, failure modes, and user-facing labels where relevant
- if a section is important, give it more room rather than forcing it into a one-line synopsis
- if you are choosing between concision and completeness, choose completeness

Style rules:
- format each section as its own heading on a separate line, followed by multiline bullets
- never merge multiple sections into one paragraph
- keep each section concise but complete
- prefer dense, specific bullets over vague summaries
- include enough detail to let the next assistant continue without re-asking the user for context
- use bullets in every section except when the section is explicitly `none`
- be specific enough that the next assistant can continue without asking the user to repeat themselves
- avoid filler, repetition, greetings, back-and-forth that does not change the work, and any meta commentary about compression
